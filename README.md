# Imitate Motions From Videos
Motion imitation is a challenging task in robotics and computer vision, typically requiring expert data obtained through MoCap devices. However, acquiring such data is resource-intensive in terms of financial resources, manpower, and time. Our project addresses this challenge by proposing a novel model that simplifies Motion Imitation into a prediction problem of joint angle values in reinforcement learning.
